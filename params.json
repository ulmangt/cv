It's available on [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#browse%7C1117099642) or on GitHub at metsci/glimpse.\r\n\r\n#### [Java Very Fast Machine Learning Toolkit](http://ulmangt.github.io/vfml/)\r\n\r\n![Weka JVFML](https://googledrive.com/host/0B9qrDMuiaIaNcjlwU082amtrak0/JVFML_Weka.png)\r\n\r\nBased on original work by Hulten, G. and Domingos, P. \"VFML -- A toolkit for mining high-speed time-changing data streams\" http://www.cs.washington.edu/dm/vfml/. 2003. This software provides a Java implementation of the stream-based decision tree algorithm described by Hulten and Domingos. The algorithm utilizes the [Chernoff (or Hoeffding) Bound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_bounds) to provide a statistical basis for when to branch the decision tree without having to re-analyze all available training examples. See: [Mining Massive Data Streams.pptx](https://drive.google.com/?authuser=0#folders/0B9qrDMuiaIaNUF9wWGNWY3dvREE) or the [JVMFL](http://ulmangt.github.io/vfml/) site for further details.\r\n\r\n#### [JCUDA Dynamic Histogram Visualization](https://github.com/ulmangt/cs706project)\r\n\r\n![Glimpse Histogram Plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ulmangt/cs706project/master/report/screenshots/glimpse/GlimpseHistogramPlot.png)\r\n\r\nThis project was an experiment in interfacing [CUDA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html) directly with [Glimpse](http://metsci.github.io/glimpse/index.html) OpenGL visualizations. In this case, using CUDA to read heat map data stored in an OpenGL texture and calculate an on-the-fly histogram of a selected subset of the data.\r\n\r\n#### [Support Vector Machine Handwriting Recognition](https://code.google.com/p/csi873/)\r\n\r\n![SVM Results](https://googledrive.com/host/0B9qrDMuiaIaNRXJaWnlvVjNpa1U/test2_5_correct5s_a0156.png)\r\n\r\n[AMPL](http://www.ampl.com/) was used to model a support vector machine optimization problem to classify low resolution images of the digits 0 through 9. Results, codes, and screenshots are available in the [final report](file:///Users/ulman/Downloads/csi873_final_ulman.pdf) or the [project site](https://code.google.com/p/csi873/).\r\n\r\n#### [Bayesian Particle Filter Tracking in CUDA](https://code.google.com/p/csi702/)\r\n\r\n![Particle Filter](https://googledrive.com/host/0B9qrDMuiaIaNRXJaWnlvVjNpa1U/azimuth_only_2900.png)\r\n\r\nCUDA provides an excellent computational framework for problems which can be described via [SIMD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) operations. However, more complicated operations like reductions (summations), filtering, or sorting require careful use of the shared memory and synchronization capabilities provided by the GPU hardware.\r\n\r\nBayesian inference using discrete particles to approximate a highly non-linear posterior probability surface is an example of such a problem which is difficult \r\n\r\n#### [Malaysian Airlines Flight 370](http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/world/2014/03/21/tsr-dnt-todd-plane-search-treacherous-water.cnn.html)\r\n\r\n![Malaysian Airlines Flight 370](https://googledrive.com/host/0B9qrDMuiaIaNRXJaWnlvVjNpa1U/CNN_Malaysian_Airline.png)\r\n\r\nMetron, Inc. was involved with the search for [Air France Flight 447](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26680633) and representatives appeared on a number of news segments following the Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 disappearance. One of those segments featured software which I developed; displaying global shipping patterns (or lack thereof) in the suspected region of the disappearance: [Dangerous Conditions Await Search Crews](http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/world/2014/03/21/tsr-dnt-todd-plane-search-treacherous-water.cnn.html).\r\n\r\n#### Data Sets\r\n\r\n### [World Bank Climate Change Data](https://github.com/ulmangt/climate-change-data)\r\n\r\nThe [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog) provides a large collection of interesting data sets. To facilitate experimenting with applying machine learning techniques to these data sets, I've converted some of their climate change data into ARFF and CSV formats readable by [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
